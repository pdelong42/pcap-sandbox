This is my attempt to learn how to use libpcap.

Writing it in C seemed like the most sensible place to start.  Once
I've grasped the core concepts, I can move on to languages I'm more
comfortable in.  My initial intent was to do this in either Perl or
Clojure.

My C is super-rusty, so try not to judge too harshly.
